# Performance Testing Strategy

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the performance testing strategy for our API project using K6, following industry best practices and MAANG company standards.

## 2. Objectives
- Ensure system reliability under various load conditions
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Validate system scalability
- Measure response times and throughput
- Ensure system stability under peak loads

## 3. Types of Performance Tests

### 3.1 Load Testing
- Baseline testing
- Peak load testing
- Endurance testing
- Stress testing

### 3.2 Scalability Testing
- Horizontal scaling
- Vertical scaling
- Auto-scaling validation

### 3.3 Stress Testing
- Breaking point identification
- Recovery testing
- Failover testing

### 3.4 Spike Testing
- Sudden load spikes
- Traffic pattern analysis

### 3.5 Soak Testing
- Long-duration testing
- Memory leak detection
- Resource utilization monitoring

## 4. Tools and Technologies

### 4.1 Primary Tools
- K6 (Load Testing)
- InfluxDB (Time Series Database)
- Grafana (Visualization)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Slack (Notifications)
- Email (Reports)

### 4.2 Monitoring Tools
- Custom Grafana Dashboards
- System Metrics Collection
- Application Performance Monitoring

## 5. Test Environment
